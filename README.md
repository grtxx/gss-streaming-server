Hi,

It's one of my very old projects, I wrote it in borland c++. 
GSS is a Shoutcast compatible MP3 streaming server with winamp dsp plugin support.
It was used by some hungarian radios.

I've tried to copy all of the needed units but please let me know if you need something for build this. You will need the directsound SDK.
